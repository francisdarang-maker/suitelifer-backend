# Schema Corrections Summary

## Date: July 14, 2025

### Issue Identified
The schema file had `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` clauses for `updated_at` columns that did not match the teammate's MySQL dump structure.

### Corrections Made
Updated the following tables to exactly match the MySQL dump provided:

#### 1. `sl_cheers` Table
- **Changed**: `updated_at` timestamp from `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- **Reason**: Match exact structure from teammate's dump

#### 2. `sl_cheer_comments` Table  
- **Changed**: `updated_at` timestamp from `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- **Reason**: Match exact structure from teammate's dump

#### 3. `sl_cheer_likes` Table
- **Changed**: `updated_at` timestamp from `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- **Reason**: Match exact structure from teammate's dump

#### 4. `sl_transactions` Table
- **Changed**: `updated_at` timestamp from `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- **Reason**: Match exact structure from teammate's dump

#### 5. `sl_user_points` Table
- **Changed**: `updated_at` timestamp from `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- **Reason**: Match exact structure from teammate's dump

### Verification
- All table structures now exactly match the teammate's MySQL dump
- Engine: InnoDB
- Character set: utf8mb4
- Collation: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
- All column types, constraints, and indexes are identical

### Database Status
The teammate's cheer tables already exist in the JLfsDB database with the correct structure and data. The schema file now accurately reflects this structure for future deployments and documentation.

### Next Steps
- Schema file is now correctly synchronized with the production database structure
- No migration needed as the tables already exist with correct structure
- API/controllers can proceed with using these tables as documented
